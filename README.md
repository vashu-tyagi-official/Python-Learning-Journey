# Python Learning Journey

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)
Welcome to my personal, open-source repository dedicated to mastering Python programming!

## Overview

This repository chronicles my journey through the vast landscape of Python, from fundamental concepts to advanced topics and practical applications. It serves as a comprehensive collection of my hands-on practice, coding challenges, algorithm implementations, and explorations into various Python libraries and paradigms.

As an open-source resource, this repository is designed not only to track my progress but also to provide a clear, structured learning path for anyone embarking on their own Python journey. Feel free to explore, learn from, and contribute to the code within!

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is a living collection of focused Python exercises and examples, organized by learning progression and specialization:

- **01-Basics**: Fundamental Python syntax, data types, control flow, basic functions, and core built-in data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets).
- **02-Intermediate**: Topics like file handling, error handling, modules & packages, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, generators, and decorators.
- **03-Advanced**: Deeper dives into advanced data structures, complex algorithms, design patterns, and concurrency/parallelism.
- **04-Applications**: Practical applications of Python in specific domains:
  - **Web Development Basics**: Introduction to frameworks like Flask and Django.
  - **Data Science Basics**: Fundamentals of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Practice Problems & Solutions**: Dedicated folders within each section containing programming challenges and their solutions to reinforce learning.
- **Miscellaneous Code Snippets**: Explorations into new Python features, library functionalities, or general coding curiosities.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

- **Personal Growth**: To systematically track and reinforce my understanding of Python programming concepts.
- **Consistent Practice**: To maintain a regular routine of coding challenges and practical exercises.
- **Reference & Review**: To serve as a living document for reviewing past solutions and learning from mistakes.
- **Community Learning**: To provide a clear, accessible, and well-organized resource for other Python enthusiasts and learners.

## Getting Started (Local Setup)

To set up this project locally and run the Python scripts:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vashu-tyagi-official/Python-Learning-Journey.git](https://github.com/vashu-tyagi-official/Python-Learning-Journey.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Python-Learning-Journey
    ```
3.  **(Recommended) Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - **Windows:** `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    - **macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
5.  **Install core dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    _Note: For specific application sections (e.g., Web Development or Data Science), you might need to install additional dependencies listed in their respective `requirements.txt` files if they are not included in the main one._
6.  **Run any Python script (e.g., a basic one):**
    ```bash
    python 01-Basics/01-Introduction/hello_world.py
    ```
