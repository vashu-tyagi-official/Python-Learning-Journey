# Python Learning Journey

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

Welcome to my personal, open-source repository dedicated to mastering Python programming!

---

## Overview

This repository chronicles my journey through the vast landscape of Python, from fundamental concepts to advanced topics and practical applications. It serves as a comprehensive collection of hands-on practice, coding challenges, algorithm implementations, and explorations into various Python libraries and paradigms.

As an open-source resource, this repository is designed not only to track my progress but also to provide a clear, structured learning path for anyone embarking on their own Python journey. Feel free to explore, learn from, and contribute to the code within!

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is a living collection of focused Python exercises and examples, organized by learning progression and specialization:

- **01-Basics**: Fundamental Python syntax, data types, control flow, basic functions, and core built-in data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets).
- **02-Intermediate**: Topics like file handling, error handling, modules & packages, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, generators, and decorators.
- **03-Advanced**: Deeper dives into advanced data structures, complex algorithms, design patterns, and concurrency/parallelism.
- **04-Applications**: Practical applications of Python in specific domains:
  - **Web Development Basics**: Introduction to frameworks like Flask and Django.
  - **Data Science Basics**: Fundamentals of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Practice Problems & Solutions**: Dedicated folders within each section containing programming challenges and their solutions to reinforce learning.
- **Miscellaneous Code Snippets**: Explorations into new Python features, library functionalities, or general coding curiosities.
